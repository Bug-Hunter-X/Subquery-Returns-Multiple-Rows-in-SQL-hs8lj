This repository demonstrates a common SQL error where a subquery returns more than one row when a single value is expected. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous SQL code, while `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version. The error arises from improper use of subqueries within the `WHERE` clause.  The solution utilizes techniques to handle multiple rows in subqueries, offering a robust fix for this SQL query issue.

The SQL query uses a subquery that returns more than one row, causing an error because the main query expects a single value.  This often happens when using aggregate functions without a `GROUP BY` clause or when joining tables improperly. For example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'London');
```
If multiple departments are located in London, the subquery returns multiple `department_id` values, causing the main query to fail.
